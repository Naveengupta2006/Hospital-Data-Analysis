# 🏥 Hospital Analysis  

A data-driven project exploring hospital records through **data cleaning, descriptive stats, grouped insights, inferential testing, and correlation analysis**.  

---

## 📌 Basic Information  
- Dataset: Hospital patient records (admission, discharge, demographics).  
- Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels).  
- Goal: Gain insights to support better hospital management & patient care.  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates & handled missing values  
- Standardized date formats (Admission & Discharge)  
- Encoded categorical variables  

---

## 📊 Descriptive Statistics  
- Patient demographics overview  
- Distribution of **Age, Stay Length, Treatment Cost**  
- Summary metrics (mean, median, std. deviation)  

---

## 📂 Grouped Analysis  
- Average hospital stay by department  
- Patient count by **gender, age group, disease type**  
- Treatment cost comparison across departments  

---

## 📈 Inferential Statistics  
- Hypothesis testing (t-test, ANOVA)  
- Chi-square for categorical relationships  
- Insights on stay duration differences  

---

## 🔗 Correlation Between Age & Discharge Date  
- Analyzed link between **Age** & **Length of Stay**  
- Scatter plots with regression line  
- Interpretation of patient discharge patterns
